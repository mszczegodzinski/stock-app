Requirements:

## About your users

- They'll probably want to buy or sell a stock after getting information from your website

* They can probably only operate on specific stock exchanges (e.g. European investors have trouble accessing US-based exchanges)

* They won't always know the symbol of the company, only the name (e.g. they might not know TSLA stands for Tesla)

* They will be interested in some information about the company other than just its name and price

## Requirements

- **Display stocks**, e.g. in a list
- Use the [**Alpha Vantage API**](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) (you can get a rate-limited API key for free)
- Spend about **6 hours** on this (you can spread it over as many days as you like)
- **Use GitHub** and give us a link to the repository - we'll also assess your skill with `git`
